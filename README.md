# Simple Networking Project #1

## Project Description

Design a network in Cisco Packet Tracer to connect the ACCOUNTS and DELIVERY departments. Each department should contain at least two PCs. Utilize the appropriate number of switches and routers in the network. Use the given network 192.168.40.0 and configure all interfaces with correct IP addresses, subnet masks, and gateways. Ensure all devices in the network are connected using appropriate cables. Test communication between devices in both ACCOUNTS and DELIVERY departments.

## Technologies Implemented

- Creating a Simple Network using a Router and Access Layer Switch.
- Connecting Networking devices with Correct cabling.
- Connecting two Networks using a Router.
- Subnetting and IP Addressing.
- Assigning IP Addresses to Router's interfaces.
- Static IP Address allocation to Host Devices.
- Testing and Verifying Network Communication.

## Network Topology

The network topology below satisfies the user requirements, and everything is verified, tested, and working fine.
